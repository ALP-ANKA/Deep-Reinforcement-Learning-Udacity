# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

For this project, we work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment. The environment for this project involves     
controlling a **double-jointed arm**, to reach target locations.  A reward of +0.1 is provided 
for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is 
to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.
