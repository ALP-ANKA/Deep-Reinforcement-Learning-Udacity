## Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Udacity

Here you can find several projects dedicated to the Deep Reinforcement Learnin methods.   
These projects are developed as part of the [**_Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program_**](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

Random-restart _hill climbing_ is a surprisingly effective algorithm in many cases.  _Simulated annealing_ is a good probabilistic     technique because it does not accidentally think a local extrema is a global extrema.
