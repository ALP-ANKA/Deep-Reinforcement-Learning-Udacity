# Project -  Cartpole with Doouble Deep Q-Learning (DDQN)

### Environment

Solving the environment require an average total reward of over **195** for _Cartpole-v0_  and **475** for _Cartpole-v1_      
over 100 consecutive episodes. A pole is attached by an joint to a cart, which moves along a track.    
The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart. The pendulum starts upright, and     
the goal is to prevent it from falling over. A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright.     
The episode ends when the pole > 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart moves > 2.4 units from the center.
