# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, we will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Environment

The environment is simulated by Unity application _Banana_ lying in the subdirectory _Banana_Windows_x86_64_
We start the environment as follows:

_env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe")_

### Training

We execute training several times in according the variable _numb_of_trains_.
For each training, the result weights are saved into the file 'weights_'+str(train_numb)+'.trn'.
For example, if _numb_of_trains_ = 5, we get files:

   _weights_0.trn,  weights_1.trn,  weights_2.trn,  weights_3.trn, weights_0.trn._

For each training we
